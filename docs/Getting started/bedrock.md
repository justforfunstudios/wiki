### Troubleshooting

- ** I get the "unknown host" error! ** -- Make sure you have typed the server address and port correctly!
- ** I get the "outdated client" error! ** -- Make sure you have installed the latest Minecraft Bedrock version!
- ** I get the "unknown world" error! ** -- Try again and if it still doesn't works, make sure you have typed the server adress and port correctly!
- ** I get the "timed out" or "connection throttled" ** -- Try again after a few seconds and if it still doesn't works, make sure you have typed the server address and port correctly and your internet connection!

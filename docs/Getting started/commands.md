# Useful commands

We created a list of useful commands for new and existing players. Each command has a short explanation of what it does. You can hover a command to copy it.

<code>/shop</code> -  Opens the shop GUI, where you can buy and sell various items

<code>/fly</code> -  Toggles fly. Use this command again to deactivate fly

<code>/msg username message</code> -  Sends a private message to a specific user, that other players can't see. Replace <code>username</code> with the actual player name and <code>message</code> with the message that you want to send. **Admins can still see your message.**

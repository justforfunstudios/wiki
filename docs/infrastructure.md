Interested in how JustForFun Works? Here's a short page about this topic.
This page contains more advanced tech terms, that you may not know. If you are probably on this page, I think you know what you're doing.

### Website

Our main website can be accesed at **justforfunmc.net**. It's the first page that potential players see, so it's very important. Details about the Minecraft server, such as IP and version, are provided.

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)

We use Cloudflare for our CDN and R2 for storage (such as resource packs).

### Game server

This is where our Minecraft servers are hosted. We use a dedicated server, hosted in Germany. 

### DDoS Protection

We use TCP Shield in order to protect our server from DDos attacks.

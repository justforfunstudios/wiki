- **I get the "unknown world" error!** -- Try again and if it still doesn't works, make sure you have typed the server adress and port correctly!
- **I get the "timed out" or "connection throttled" error** -- Try again after a few seconds and if it still doesn't works, make sure you have typed the server address and port correctly and your internet connection!
